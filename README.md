# Parrellel-Programming
This a C/MPI repository to contain my work for Parrellel Programming, COMP428, at Concordia University during the Fall 2017 semester.

## Modules
- [Assignments](https://github.com/prince-chrismc/Parrellel-Programming/tree/master/Assignments) { [A1](https://github.com/prince-chrismc/Parrellel-Programming/tree/master/Assignments/A1), [A2](https://github.com/prince-chrismc/Parrellel-Programming/tree/master/Assignments/A2), [A3](https://github.com/prince-chrismc/Parrellel-Programming/tree/master/Assignments/A3) }
- Labs: Notes and samples from Labs/Tutorials

## System Requirements
- This needs to be run on an MPI network from a Linux machine... see [this](https://github.com/prince-chrismc/Parrellel-Programming/blob/master/Labs/intro.md) for details. Easiest from ENCS computer.
